*My First Tailwindcss Project*


This is my project built from a template I saw online. Its actually my first tailwindcss website. I should be proud, shouldnt I?
I guess I should. originally, the template is suppose to have a hamburger button which houses the navigation links in a smaller screen. I have limited knowledge in javascript
and so I didnt include it. would come back to this project. but you can help out and create a pull request. I'll gladly merge and learn.
while youre here,
